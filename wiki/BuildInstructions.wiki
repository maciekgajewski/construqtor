I will build windows and linux x86 (and maybe amd64) binaries on each version release.

How to build:

  # Get Qt-4.3 or newer
  # Get sources from Subversion repo
  # Use qmake to generate makefile/VS project
  # Build
  # Enjoy

== Get Qt ==
Qt comes with each own development tools. It is available on any modern Linux distro. For windows, get Qt here: http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows

== Get source ==
See 'source' tab. You need subversion client.

== Configure ==
Use Qt's 'qmake' to generate project/makefile from constructor.pro.

== Build ==
Use build tool to which Qt was configured

On Linux box, I would do:
{{{
svn checkout http://construqtor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ construqtor-read-only
cd construqtor-read-only
qmake-qt4 constructor.pro
make
}}}
